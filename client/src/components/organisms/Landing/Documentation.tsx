            Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts
          </h1>
          <p>
            Smart contracts are self-executing agreements encoded in code and
            stored on blockchain networks, enabling automated transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            They run on decentralized networks, eliminating the need for
            intermediaries and ensuring transparency. With predefined rules,
            smart contracts automatically execute actions when conditions are
            met, streamlining processes and reducing errors
          </p>
          <p>
            This automation also cuts costs by bypassing traditional
            intermediaries, making transactions more efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nestage smart contracts are programmed in such a way that they never
            store participants' funds. The purpose of the smart contract is to
            automatically redirect funds from incoming transactions to the
            wallets of other participants, according to marketing program rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            To become a Nestage member, you need a personal{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">crypto wallet.</span>
          </p>
